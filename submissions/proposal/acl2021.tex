\section{Paper ID 41: Symptom Similarity Analysis}
\subsection{General Problem}
The first paper we propose reproducing is \citet{zhang_2019} by \citeauthor*{zhang_2019}. The primary goal of this paper is to rate the similarity of pairs of sentences. The idea is to aid prediction of disease by automatically identifying similarities in descriptions of patient symptoms. However, the paper does not use healthcare-related text.

\subsection{Specific Novel Approach}
The authors preprocess each sentence by extracting its ``trunk'' -- the subject, predicate and object. Sentence similarity may identified more reliably by using these trunks.

\subsection{Specific Hypotheses to Verify}
We propose reproducing experiment 1. This creates and tests a classifier using a dataset of human-labeled sentence similarities. Experiment 1 compares the authors' method to a baseline plus the methods in four related papers.

\subsection{Additional Ablations}
Possible Ablations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Incorporate synonyms, antonyms, and other word relationships into the model to gauge how this affects ratings of sentence similarities. The paper doesn't use healthcare data, so normal English synonyms could be a proxy for gauging whether the model's performance on healthcare data would improve by incorporating medical ontologies. One potential source of synonyms is the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/duketemon/wordnet-synonyms}{WordNet synonyms dataset} on Kaggle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Access}
The training and testing datasets are public: the \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398}{Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus} (MSRP) and the SemEval \href{https://github.com/brmson/dataset-sts/tree/master/data/sts/semeval-sts}{Semantic Text Similarity} (STS) datasets.

\subsection{Computational Feasibility}
The training dataset is small: 4,076 pairs of sentences. The authors use the \href{https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml}{Stanford Parser} to extract sentence trunks, and this parser is publicly available. Finally, the authors' model uses only a small CNN, with one convolution layer and one pooling layer. We do not anticipate challenges in terms of computation power. 

\subsection{Code Reuse}
State whether you will re-use existing code (and provide a link to that code base) or whether you will implement yourself.

To date, the authors have not responded to our request for code. We would implement these methods ourselves. 

We can use the Python module \href{https://spacy.io/}{Spacy} or the \href{https://www.nltk.org/}{Natural Language Tool Kit} as tools for word tokenization and dependency parsing. 

\section{Paper ID 68: Multilevel Representation Learning}
\subsection{General Problem}
\cite{sohn_2020}
What is the general problem this work is trying to do? We are not asking for the specific approach, that’s requested below. An example of a general problem is ‘mortality prediction.’ An example of a specific approach is ‘using recurrent neural network and attention mechanism.’ Do not copy the description in the paper – use your own rewording.

\subsection{Specific Approach}
What is the new specific approach being taken in this work, and what is interesting or innovative about it, in your opinion?

\subsection{Specific Hypotheses to Verify}
What are the specific hypotheses from the paper that you plan to verify in your reproduction study?

\subsection{Additional Ablations}
What are the additional ablations you plan to do, and why are they interesting?

\subsection{Data Access}
State how you are assured that you have access to the appropriate data.

\subsection{Computational Feasibility}
Discuss the computational feasibility of your proposed work – make an argument that the reproduction will be feasible.

\subsection{Code Reuse}
State whether you will re-use existing code (and provide a link to that code base) or whether you will implement yourself.
