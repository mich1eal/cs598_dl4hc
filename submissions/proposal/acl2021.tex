\section{Introduction}


\section{Topic 1: Symptom Similarity Analysis}
\subsection{General Problem}
\cite{zhang_2019}
What is the general problem this work is trying to do? We are not asking for the specific approach, that’s requested below. An example of a general problem is ‘mortality prediction.’ An example of a specific approach is ‘using recurrent neural network and attention mechanism.’ Do not copy the description in the paper – use your own rewording.

\subsection{Specific Approach}
What is the new specific approach being taken in this work, and what is interesting or innovative about it, in your opinion?

\subsection{Specific Hypotheses to Verify}
What are the specific hypotheses from the paper that you plan to verify in your reproduction study?

\subsection{Additional Ablations}
What are the additional ablations you plan to do, and why are they interesting?

\subsection{Data Access}
State how you are assured that you have access to the appropriate data.

\subsection{Computational Feasibility}
Discuss the computational feasibility of your proposed work – make an argument that the reproduction will be feasible.

\subsection{Code Reuse}
State whether you will re-use existing code (and provide a link to that code base) or whether you will implement yourself.
